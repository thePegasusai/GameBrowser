# Contributing to Browser-Based Video Game Diffusion Model

## Introduction

Welcome to the Browser-Based Video Game Diffusion Model (BVGDM) project! This project implements a client-side machine learning system for generating and transforming video game footage in real-time using TensorFlow.js. We appreciate your interest in contributing and have established these guidelines to ensure high-quality, secure, and performant contributions.

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and professional environment for all contributors. Please:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language

git clone https://github.com/your-username/bvgdm.git
cd bvgdm
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
npm run test           # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e      # End-to-end tests
npm run test:perf     # Performance benchmarks
```

## Development Process

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: New features
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
- `perf/*`: Performance improvements

### Code Standards

#### ML-Specific Guidelines

1. Model Implementation:
   - Use TensorFlow.js best practices
   - Implement proper tensor disposal
   - Document model architecture and parameters

2. Performance Requirements:
   - Frame generation: <50ms per frame
   - Memory usage: <4GB RAM
   - GPU utilization: <80%
   - Model load time: <5s

3. WebGL Optimization:
   - Maintain single WebGL context
   - Implement proper resource cleanup
   - Use appropriate data types and formats

#### Code Style

- Use ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Follow TypeScript strict mode guidelines
- Document complex algorithms and ML operations
- Include performance impact in comments

### Testing Requirements

1. Unit Tests:
   - Model component validation
   - Utility function testing
   - WebGL context management

2. Integration Tests:
   - End-to-end ML pipeline
   - Browser compatibility
   - Memory management

3. Performance Tests:
   - Frame generation benchmarks
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - GPU utilization tracking

## Technical Guidelines
